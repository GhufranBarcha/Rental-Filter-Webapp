# Comprehensive House Search App

This project is a web application that allows users to filter and search for houses based on various criteria such as the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, square footage, price per square foot, percentage change in price, and neighborhood. The app provides an interactive and user-friendly interface where users can easily adjust the parameters and see the filtered results in real-time.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language used to develop the application.
- **Pandas**: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library in Python, used to load and filter the housing dataset.
- **Gradio**: A Python library that allows you to quickly create user interfaces for machine learning models or data applications. In this project, Gradio is used to build the interactive web interface.
- **Hugging Face Spaces**: The platform where the web app is hosted, providing easy access and sharing of the application.

## Features

- **Multiple Filters**: Users can filter houses based on the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, price, and neighborhood.
- **Dynamic Filtering**: The app dynamically updates the filtered results based on the input parameters provided by the user.
- **Interactive Interface**: The interface is easy to use, allowing users to explore different combinations of filters and see the corresponding results immediately.
